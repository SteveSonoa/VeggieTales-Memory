# An Introduction to VeggieTales Memory
Don't forget your veggies! This React-based game will have you remember which vegetables you've clicked as they dance around the page. How many can you get before you click a duplicate? Try to get them all!

### How does it work?
The main components I used were the header and the icon. I took stats from each character, imported the json array, and created icons using the .map function to pass the props to the Component.

The app’s tracked state includes the Icon component (whether “clicked” is true or false for each element), the current score, the high score, and the message (which will change from “Click A Veggie!” to “GAME OVER!”).

### Who will use this?
Fans of puzzles and the popular VeggieTales series would love a game to play.

### What is the goal?
This is my first React app. The goal is to click on as many icons as possible without duplicating a result. With 12 icons, the maximum score is 12. The app stores high scores from your session, but the data does not persist and is not saved.

# Deployment
After downloading the files, you will need to run a Yarn Install, Yarn Build, and Yarn Start to begin the process.
